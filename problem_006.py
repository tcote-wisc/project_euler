"""
Project Euler Problem 006:
    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one 
    hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

    Ex. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

            12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

            (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
        
    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 

            3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
